        <p><em>Architect at <strong><a href="https://www.alliesandmorrison.com/">Allies and Morrison</a></strong></em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Currently working as an architect at the architecture and urban planning international practice Allies and Morrison in London
          where I have been involved in cutting edge projects such as the new BBC Studios at our budding Stratford East cultural hub
          where I am currently finalising Stage 4 and a new office development in Canada Water. <br>
          Previously I worked for four years at the Cambridge based architectural practise MCW Architects where I was involved as
          a fully qualified architect in several educational projects, including the University of Northampton Learning Hub, the Energy
          Centre, Barnfield College and the new Library at the University of Bedfordshire. <br>
          I have a keen interest in technological innovation to support the design process and is one of the reasons why I became one
          of the key people to implement the BIM system in MCW. This has given me an in-depth knowledge of Autodesk Revit. Outside
          of the office, I have been broadening my knowledge, trying out Dynamo and other software.
